# Week 1 notes (course)

Week 1 introduces the vocabulary and basic tooling used throughout the module.

Topics:
- network components and roles (host, switch, router)
- addresses, subnets and default gateway
- what a port is and how it maps to a process
- how to observe system state with `ip` and `ss`

This kit focuses on hands-on verification, not on lengthy theory. Use it to practise the commands and to produce evidence in `artifacts/`.
