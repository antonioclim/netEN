# requirements.txt - Starterkit Week 2
#
# This week uses Python standard library modules for the socket exercises.
# There are no mandatory pip dependencies for the core workflow.
#
# Optional: if you want coloured logs in your own extensions, you may add
# a logging helper package, but it is not required by the kit.
