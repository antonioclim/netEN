# Week 1 notes (seminar)

The seminar path is designed as a short, reproducible workflow:
1. inspect the current network state
2. run small TCP and UDP experiments
3. capture traffic and extract simple statistics
4. validate the artefacts with an automated smoke test

Use `scripts/run_all.sh` for the end-to-end demo. If you do not have Mininet installed, run `scripts/run_all.sh --quick`.
