# Week 3 seminar plan

## Agenda
1. Warm-up: UDP vs TCP, what each guarantees and what it does not
2. Broadcast demo: sender, receiver, capture and interpretation
3. Multicast demo: group join, sender, receiver, capture and IGMP
4. TCP tunnel demo: forwarding between endpoints, capture and framing discussion
5. Wrap-up: reproducibility checklist and student deliverable expectations

## Minimal command set
- `ip a`, `ip r`
- `ss -tulpn`
- `tcpdump -i any -n`
- `tshark -r <file>.pcap`

## Success criteria
Students can run the demos, explain the observed packets and submit a passing smoke test run.
