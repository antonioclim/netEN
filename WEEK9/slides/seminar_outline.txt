WEEK 9 – Seminar Outline (Session, Presentation and File Protocols)

Footer: ASE Bucharest | Computer Networks | Revolvix

SLIDE 1: Context and goals
- Session layer basics: sessions, checkpoints, recovery
- Presentation layer basics: encoding, serialisation, compression
- File protocol patterns: request, response, metadata, integrity

SLIDE 2: Week 9 toolkit map
- scripts/ for setup, demo and cleanup
- python/ for client, server and utilities
- mininet/ for topologies and scenarios
- tests/ for smoke checks and expected outputs
- docker/ for reproducible demo run

SLIDE 3: Quickstart (host)
1. make setup
2. make demo
3. make test

SLIDE 4: Ports and addressing
- Subnet: 10.0.9.0/24
- Server: 10.0.9.100
- TCP demo port: 9090
- Optional HTTP port: 8080

SLIDE 5: Demo protocol overview
- Header: magic, version, flags, length, checksum
- Commands: LIST, GET, PUT, INFO
- Status markers: OK, ERROR

SLIDE 6: Encoding pitfalls
- Bytes vs text
- UTF-8 roundtrips
- Network byte order (big endian) for binary headers

SLIDE 7: Python utilities
- struct.pack uses '>' for network byte order
- hashlib for deterministic digests
- argparse for stable CLI

SLIDE 8: Mininet scenarios
- topo_base for baseline
- topo_extended for delay and multi-client
- scenarios/lab_tasks.md for step-by-step instructions

SLIDE 9: Traffic capture
1. Start the capture:
   scripts/capture_traffic.sh 9090 artifacts/demo.pcap
2. Generate traffic (demo client-server)
3. Stop the capture with Ctrl+C
4. Analyse:
   tshark -r artifacts/demo.pcap -q -z conv,tcp

SLIDE 10: Validation
- artifacts/demo.log created
- artifacts/validation.txt created
- tests/smoke_test.sh exits with code 0

SLIDE 11: Docker demo
- make docker-demo
- artefacts written to ./artifacts on the host
- make docker-clean for teardown

SLIDE 12: Common problems and solutions
| Problem | Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connection refused | Server not running | Check ss -tlnp and the configured port |
| Invalid magic | Protocol mismatch | Check client and server versions |
| CRC mismatch | Corrupted data | Check compression on/off and re-run |

SLIDE 13: Practice tasks (choose at least 2)
- Add an INFO command to return server stats
- Add a rate limit flag on the server
- Add a retry policy on the client with a timeout

SLIDE 14: Final checklist
- Demo completed
- Smoke test passed
- Optional: pcap capture produced
- Reflection notes completed

SLIDE 15: Next week preview
- Network services in containers: DNS, SSH and file services
- Docker command review
- Name resolution and troubleshooting

SLIDE 16: Support
- During the lab: ask in class
- After the seminar: email or the course forum
