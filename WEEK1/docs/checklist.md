# Week 1 checklist

Use this checklist before submitting your work.

## Required
- You can run `bash scripts/run_all.sh` on a clean Linux VM
- `bash tests/smoke_test.sh` exits with code `0`
- `artifacts/demo.log` exists and is readable
- `artifacts/validation.txt` exists and summarises the run

## Optional
- `artifacts/demo.pcap` exists if capture is enabled
- Docker demo works via `make docker-demo`

## Quality
- You did not rename or move any files
- You did not hard-code machine-specific paths
- Your output is deterministic enough for the smoke test
