# Week 3 lab guide

## Tasks
1. Run the broadcast receiver and sender, then explain what the receiver sees and why
2. Run the multicast receiver and sender, then explain the role of group membership
3. Run the TCP tunnel demo and identify the forwarded connection in a packet capture
4. Modify one example to add a simple sequence number and confirm ordering behaviour

## Deliverables
- command log (copy/paste is acceptable)
- one short packet capture analysis (5–10 packets annotated)
- confirmation that `./tests/smoke_test.sh` exits with `0`
