- Visual: Structure template

SLIDE 4: Topology diagram - Requirements

- IP addresses visible
- Data flow marked with arrows
- Services highlighted (e.g.: HTTP server on h2)
- Example: good diagram vs poor diagram

SLIDE 5: Live demonstration - Tips
- Prepare environment BEFOREHAND (VM started, Mininet clean)
- Test 2-3 times in advance
- Have a backup (pre-recorded capture)
- Explain what you are doing and WHAT YOU EXPECT to see
- Visual: Demo preparation checklist

================================================================================
SECTION C: EVALUATION CRITERIA (10 min, 5 slides)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIDE 6: Evaluation grid - General view
- Technical complexity: 40 points
- Functionality: 30 points
- Presentation: 20 points
- Documentation: 10 points
- Total: 100 points
- Visual: Pie chart with percentages

SLIDE 7: Technical complexity (40p)
- Excellent (36-40p): Multi-hop routing, multiple services, load balancing
- Good (28-35p): Topology with router, at least 2 services
- Acceptable (20-27p): Simple topology, 1 functional service
- Insufficient (<20p): Only ping between hosts
- Visual: Graded scale with examples

SLIDE 8: Functionality (30p)
- Excellent (27-30p): Everything works, fluid demo, capture interpretation
- Good (21-26p): Main functionality OK, minor issues
- Acceptable (15-20p): Partially functional demo, requires interventions
- Insufficient (<15p): Demo fails, cannot explain results
- Visual: Graded scale

SLIDE 9: Presentation (20p)
- Excellent (18-20p): Clear, structured, answers questions confidently
- Good (14-17p): Good presentation, some hesitations at questions
- Acceptable (10-13p): Disorganised, but correct content
- Insufficient (<10p): Cannot explain own solution
- Visual: Graded scale

SLIDE 10: Documentation (10p)
- Excellent (9-10p): Complete README, clear diagrams, commented code
- Good (7-8p): Adequate documentation, missing minor details
- Acceptable (5-6p): Minimal documentation
- Insufficient (<5p): Missing or incorrect documentation
- Visual: Graded scale

================================================================================
SECTION D: DEFENCE QUESTIONS (10 min, 5 slides)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIDE 11: Question types - Overview
- Understanding questions (What does this code segment do?)
- Application questions (What would happen if...?)
- Analysis questions (Why did you choose this approach?)
- Evaluation questions (What are the limitations?)
- Visual: Differentiated icons per type

SLIDE 12: Examples - Understanding questions
- "Explain line X from your code."
- "What protocol does your service use and why?"
- "How does the packet get from h1 to h3?"
- "What does this entry in the routing table represent?"
- Tip: Know your code line by line

SLIDE 13: Examples - Application questions
- "If I add a fourth host, what changes do I make?"
- "How would I test that the load balancer distributes correctly?"
- "What command do I use to see HTTP traffic?"
- "How do I verify that the service is listening on port X?"
- Tip: Think of alternative scenarios

SLIDE 14: Examples - Analysis questions
- "Why TCP and not UDP for your service?"
- "What advantages and disadvantages does your topology have?"
- "How would you debug if the client does not receive a response?"
- "What does this pattern in the capture indicate?"
- Tip: Prepare justifications for decisions

SLIDE 15: Examples - Evaluation questions
- "What is the biggest limitation of your solution?"
- "What would you improve if you had more time?"
- "How would the system behave with 100 clients?"
- "What should be added for production?"
- Tip: Be honest about limitations - it is appreciated

================================================================================
SECTION E: RAPID TROUBLESHOOTING (8 min, 4 slides)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIDE 16: Frequent demo problems
- Mininet does not start: check previous processes (`sudo mn -c`)
- Port occupied: identify and stop the process (`lsof -i :PORT`)
- Service does not respond: check correct IP, firewall
- Empty capture: check correct interface
- Visual: Problem → solution table

SLIDE 17: Rescue commands
- `sudo mn -c` - clean Mininet
- `pkill -f python` - stop Python scripts
- `ip link show` - check interfaces
- `ss -tlnp` - check ports
- `tcpdump -i any -c 10` - quick capture test

SLIDE 18: If the demo fails
- DO NOT panic
- Explain what SHOULD HAVE happened
- Show pre-recorded capture (backup)
- Discuss where you think the problem is
- The evaluator appreciates diagnostic capability

SLIDE 19: Final checklist before presentation
□ VM started and Mininet clean
□ Code updated and tested
□ Backup capture prepared
□ Diagram printed/visible
□ Timer for timing
□ Water for presenter
- Visual: Interactive checklist

================================================================================
SECTION F: PRESENTATION ORDER (5 min, 2 slides)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIDE 20: Session timeline
- [Completed by instructor with teams]
- Format: Team X - HH:MM - HH:MM
- Break at halfway (5-10 min)
- Buffer for delays
- Visual: Simplified Gantt chart

SLIDE 21: Room rules
- Next team prepared (VM started)
- Respect allocated time
- Questions: only during Q&A
- Constructive feedback encouraged
- Visual: Rule icons

================================================================================
SECTION G: CLOSING (2 min, 1 slide)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIDE 22: Good luck!
- Have confidence in your work
- Ask for clarifications if you do not understand the question
- Demonstrate that you UNDERSTAND, not just that you copied
- Message: "Best of luck with your presentations!"
- Visual: Thumbs up / celebration icon

================================================================================
TOTAL TIMING: ~45 min instructor presentation
TOTAL SLIDES: 22

REMAINING TIME: Team presentations (~8-10 min/team × number of teams)

INSTRUCTOR NOTES:
- Slides 7-10: can be used as printed handout
- Slide 20: complete with teams from the group
- Maintain flexibility in timing for questions
- Note scores in real time or immediately after
