Week 7 topology diagram (router firewall)

      (10.0.7.0/25)                    (10.0.7.128/25)
  h1:10.0.7.11 ---- s1 ---- fw ---- s2 ---- h2:10.0.7.200
                      |      |
                 fw-eth0  fw-eth1
                 10.0.7.1 10.0.7.129

Traffic between h1 and h2 must pass through fw, which is where filtering rules apply.
