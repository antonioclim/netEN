WEEK 4 seminar slide outline
Workshop: building reliable messages over TCP and UDP

This outline is designed for import into PowerPoint, Google Slides or reveal.js.
Each [SLIDE X] section is one slide.

[SLIDE 1]
Title: Week 4 seminar
Subtitle: Custom TEXT and BINARY protocols over TCP and UDP

[SLIDE 2]
Workshop structure (100 minutes)
- 10 min: framing and integrity recap
- 20 min: run the demo and read artefacts
- 25 min: modify the TEXT protocol (new command)
- 25 min: extend the binary format (new field)
- 15 min: UDP edge cases and parsing safety
- 5 min: verification and clean reset

[SLIDE 3]
Rules of the exercise
- Work from the CLI
- Keep outputs deterministic
- Use the smoke test to validate changes
- Do not hardcode external dependencies

[SLIDE 4]
Quickstart (commands)
- ./scripts/setup.sh
- ./scripts/run_all.sh
- ./tests/smoke_test.sh
- ./scripts/cleanup.sh

[SLIDE 5]
Reading the demo artefacts
- demo.log: chronological execution trace
- validation.txt: summary markers for automated checks
- demo.pcap: optional capture when permitted

[SLIDE 6]
Hands-on: TEXT protocol
- Open python/apps/text_proto_server.py
- Identify command parsing and dispatch
- Add one new command (example: TIME, ECHO or INFO)
- Update the client sequence in scripts/run_all.sh if needed

[SLIDE 7]
Validation for TEXT protocol
- Confirm server starts and accepts connections
- Confirm client receives OK responses
- Keep error messages stable where tests depend on them

[SLIDE 8]
Hands-on: BINARY protocol
- Open python/apps/binary_proto_server.py and client
- Locate struct formats and message types
- Add one new field or message type
- Ensure both ends remain compatible

[SLIDE 9]
Validation for BINARY protocol
- Re-run run_all.sh
- Confirm validation.txt includes BINARY protocol: OK
- If decoding fails, align endianness and field widths

[SLIDE 10]
Hands-on: UDP sensor
- Review udp_sensor_server.py parsing
- Add input validation and timeouts
- Discuss reliability patterns: retry, sequence numbers, acknowledgements

[SLIDE 11]
Traffic inspection (optional)
- tcpdump on loopback with a port filter
- tshark to read pcap and filter by port
- If capture fails, proceed without it

[SLIDE 12]
Wrap-up
- Run ./tests/smoke_test.sh
- Ensure artefacts exist and markers are present
- Clean up the environment to a known baseline
