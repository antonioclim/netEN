    **Issues:**
    • Head-of-Line Blocking
    • 6-8 connections per domain
    • Repeated headers
    • Sequential processing
  end note

package "HTTP/2" as H2 #E8F5E9 {
  rectangle "Single Connection" as C3 {
    rectangle "Stream 1" as S1 #66BB6A
    rectangle "Stream 2" as S2 #4CAF50
    rectangle "Stream 3" as S3 #43A047

    **Advantages:**
    • Multiplexing on one connection
    • HPACK header compression
    • Stream prioritisation
    • Server Push (optional)
    • Identical HTTP semantics

note as N1
  **HTTP/1.1:**
  Requests are processed
  sequentially per connection.
  Browser opens multiple
  TCP connections.
end note

note as N2
  **HTTP/2:**
  All requests in parallel
  on the same TCP connection.
  Binary framing allows
  frame interleaving.
end note
