note bottom of unicast
    * Single destination
    * Most efficient for P2P
    * Standard TCP/UDP
    
    Example: HTTP, SSH
end note

note bottom of broadcast
    * All hosts receive
    * L2 segment only
    * High network load
    
    Example: ARP, DHCP
end note

note bottom of multicast
    * Only interested receive
    * Crosses routers (IGMP)
    * Efficient streaming
    
    Example: IPTV, Stocks
end note
