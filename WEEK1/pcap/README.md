# PCAP folder

This folder is used for sample captures and for outputs produced by the demo.

- `scripts/run_all.sh` writes `artifacts/demo.pcap` if capture is enabled.
- `scripts/capture_demo.sh` can generate additional example captures in this folder.

Do not edit binary capture files when preparing your submission.
