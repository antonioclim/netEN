# PCAP folder

This folder contains packet capture artefacts when capture is enabled.

- Automated runs may write `artifacts/demo.pcap`
- If capture is disabled or restricted by the environment, this folder may remain empty

Do not commit large captures unless required for assessment. Prefer short, filtered captures that demonstrate a specific observation.
