# Suggested workflow for the lab and reporting

## Key ideas

Focus on observable network behaviour, minimal reproducible steps and verifiable artefacts.

## Practical link

Each concept should map to a command or a script in `scripts/`, `python/` or `mininet/`.

## What to record

Capture commands, outputs and short interpretations in `artifacts/` and keep them consistent with `tests/expected_outputs.md`.
